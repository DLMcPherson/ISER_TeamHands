# Out of Plane Rolling via Simple Pushing Robot Team
My drafted extended abstract for submitting to ISER. We examine using a squad of robots as a delocalized "hand".
Compile with BibTeX and XeLaTeX.


As robots make the migratory leap from well-controlled factory cages into the rough-and-tumble of natural environments, a growing theme is physical interaction.
From one research direction, we examine how the robot interacts with the surrounding terrain to locomote.
From a complementary direction, we examine how to design robot hands or grippers to manipulate objects.
In this work we fuse these two interaction types to form **manipulation via locomotion**.
We integrate classic work in manipulation into studies on collaborative robotic transport to add extra manipulation DOF to a sort of delocalized robot hand.
